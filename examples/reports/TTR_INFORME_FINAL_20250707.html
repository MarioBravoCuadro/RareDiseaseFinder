The encoded protein, transthyretin, is a homo-tetrameric carrier protein, which transports thyroid hormones in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. It is also involved in the transport of retinol (vitamin A) in the plasma by associating with retinol-binding protein. The protein may also be involved in other intracellular processes including proteolysis, nerve regeneration, autophagy and glucose homeostasis. Mutations in this gene are associated with amyloid deposition, predominantly affecting peripheral nerves or the heart, while a small percentage of the gene mutations are non-amyloidogenic. The mutations are implicated in the etiology of several diseases, including amyloidotic polyneuropathy, euthyroid hyperthyroxinaemia, amyloidotic vitreous opacities, cardiomyopathy, oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis, meningocerebrovascular amyloidosis and carpal tunnel syndrome.

AMYLD1 is an autosomal dominant form due to transthyretin amyloid deposition. Protein fibrils can form in different tissues leading to amyloid polyneuropathies, amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, systemic senile amyloidosis. The disease includes leptomeningeal amyloidosis that is characterized by primary involvement of the central nervous system. Neuropathologic examination shows amyloid in the walls of leptomeningeal vessels, in pia arachnoid, and subpial deposits. Some patients also develop vitreous amyloid deposition that leads to visual impairment (oculoleptomeningeal amyloidosis). Clinical features include seizures, stroke-like episodes, dementia, psychomotor deterioration, variable amyloid deposition in the vitreous humor.","OMIM":"https://www.omim.org/entry/105210","Publications":"10036587, 10071047, 10211412, 10436378, 10439117, 10611950, 10627135, 10694917, 10842705, 10842718, 10882995, 11243784, 11445644, 11866053, 12050338, 12403615, 12557757, 12771253, 1301926, 1351039, 1362222, 1436517, 1517749, 1520326, 1520336, 15214015, 15217993, 1544214, 15478468, 1570831, 15735344, 16185074, 1656975, 16627944, 1734866, 17453626, 17503405, 17577687, 17635579, 19167329, 1932142, 2046936, 2161654, 23317988, 2363717, 2891727, 3022108, 3135807, 3722385, 3818577, 6487335, 6583672, 6651852, 7655883, 7850982, 7910950, 7914929, 7923855, 8019560, 8038017, 8081397, 8095302, 8133316, 8257997, 8352764, 8382610, 8428915, 8579098, 8990019, 9066351, 9605286, 9733771, Ref.91"},{"Nombre":"Hyperthyroxinemia, dystransthyretinemic","Acronym":"DTTRH","Description":"A condition characterized by elevation of total and free thyroxine in healthy, euthyroid persons without detectable binding protein abnormalities.","OMIM":"https://www.omim.org/entry/145680","Publications":"1979335"},{"Nombre":"Carpal tunnel syndrome 1","Acronym":"CTS1","Description":"A condition characterized by entrapment of the median nerve within the carpal tunnel.

Hereditary amyloidosisis characterized by the deposit of an abnormal protein called amyloid in multiple organs of the body where it should not be, which causes disruption of organ tissue structure and function. In hereditary amyloidosis, amyloid deposits most often occur in tissues of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. While symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis may appear in childhood, most individuals do not experience symptoms until adulthood. There are many types of hereditary amyloidosis associated with different gene mutations and abnormal proteins. The most common type of hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR),a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. Other examplesof hereditary amyloidosis include, but are not limited to, apolipoprotein AI amyloidosis (A ApoAI), gelsolin amyloidosis (A Gel), lysozyme amyloidosis (A Lys), cystatin C amyloidosis (A Cys), fibrinogen Aα-chain amyloidosis (A Fib), and apolipoprotein AII amyloidosis (A ApoAII). Most types of hereditary amyloidosis are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

As an alternative gene-level intervention, Intellia Therapeutics have conducted a first-in-human trial of their <i>in vivo</i> CRISPR/Cas9 TTR genome editing candidate, NTLA-2001 (NCT04601051) <Reference id=42413/>. NTLA-2001 reduced serum levels of transthyretin. The orally administered, small molecule TTR stabilising drugs tafamidis and acoramidis are authorised for the treament of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). TTR stabilisers inhibit dissociation of the tetrameric protein complex into the monomeric units that can misfold and accumulate as toxic TTR amyloid deposits within organs.","GeneExpressionAndPathophysiologyComments":"Excess production and accumulation of transthyretin (TTR) causes hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. Drugs that directly inhibit <i>TTR</i> expression (of both wild type and mutant TTR) in the liver, are now approved for use in clinical
